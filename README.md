## Introduction

The aim of this project is to create a nostalgic and engaging user experience. This website is a tribute to the early days of the web, while at the same time showcasing my professional background. The pages are designed to be simple, light, and compatible with any browser.

## Usage

The website is divided into four main pages:

- `About Me`: Provides a brief introduction about myself, including my personal background and professional interests.
- `Education`: Details my academic background and achievements.
- `Work Experience`: Outlines my professional experience, highlighting my roles in each position.
- `Skills`: Provides an overview of my technical and non-technical skills.

## Live Demo

You can explore a live demo of the website directly from GitHub. Just go to the `Environments` section on the right side of the repository page and click on `View deployment`. This will take you directly to the live, functioning website so you can interact with it in real-time. 

Please note that the website may take a few moments to load depending on your internet speed. Enjoy the nostalgic trip back to the 90s web!
